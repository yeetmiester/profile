        <h1 id="Proj">Projects</h3>
        <p>I have done several coding projects with CodeNext. We began by using javascript. A couple of them include a Fantasy Name Generator, a program that calculates change, and a story using if else commands.x Now, we are moving onto website design with HTML and CSS. </p>
        <h1 id="UR">Urealms</h4>
        <p>I play a DnD inspired game called Urealms. The actual game is an online show done by a group of friends. I've been watching and supporting their live show for years now, and decided to bring it to my life by playing it with a group of close friends. We play every other Friday, and it's a ton of fun. Right now, we are early in our newest campaign, Azveltara Z.</p>
        <h1 id="Con">Contacts</h5>
        <p>I have an Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. My Instagram is che.a.glenn, my Snapchat is ihatelifejklol, and I dont actually have a Facebook I don't know why I said I did earlier.</p>
